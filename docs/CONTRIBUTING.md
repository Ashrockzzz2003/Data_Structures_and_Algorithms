## **Getting Started**  

### **Clone the Repository**  

To get started, pull the repository to your local machine:  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/Ashrockzzz2003/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms.git  
cd Data_Structures_and_Algorithms  
```  

---  

## **How to Contribute**  

### **1. Fork the Repository**  

Start by forking this repository to create a copy under your GitHub account.  
- Hit the **Fork** button on the repository page.  

Clone your forked version:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms.git  
cd Data_Structures_and_Algorithms  
```  
*(Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.)*  

### **2. Set Upstream**  

To keep your fork up-to-date with the original repository:  
```bash  
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Ashrockzzz2003/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms.git  
```  

### **3. Create a New Branch**  

Before making any changes, create a new branch:  
```bash  
git checkout -b feature/<branch-name>  
```  
Examples:  
- `feature/add-dijkstra`  
- `fix/binary-search-bug`  

Now youâ€™re all set to start coding!

## **What Can You Contribute?**  

Thereâ€™s plenty to do! Here are some ways you can help:  

1. **New Algorithms**: If you have an algorithm weâ€™re missing, bring it in!  
2. **Bug Fixes**: Fixing those pesky bugs!  
3. **Documentation**: Add examples, comments, or improve the README. This helps others understand the code better.  
4. **Different approach and Proposing new problem**: New approach to solve a existing problem in the repository. And if you feel like something could be added as a problem feel free to use the open issue and put your problem request as comments.

---  

## **Submitting Your Changes**  

Once your changes are ready:  

1. **Commit Your Work**  
   Write clear and concise commit messages:  
   ```bash  
   git commit -m "Add: Quick Sort implementation in Python"  
   ```  

2. **Push Your Branch**  
   Send your changes to your fork:  
   ```bash  
   git push origin feature/<branch-name>  
   ```  

3. **Open a Pull Request**  
   - Head to the original repository.  
   - Click **Pull Requests** > **New Pull Request**.  
   - Select your branch, add a meaningful title and description, and submit the PR. Let it be short and crisp.  

4. **Feedback Time**  
   Reviewers might leave commentsâ€”donâ€™t worry, itâ€™s all to make your work shine! Update your code and resubmit when needed.

## **Coding Standards**  

Great code is readable and consistent. Here are some tips to keep in mind:  

- **Document Your Code**: Add comments, especially for tricky parts.  
- **Follow Standards**:  
  - **Python**: Stick to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).  
  - **Java**: Follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).  
  - **C++**: Use camelCase for variables and meaningful function names.  
  - **Go**: Adhere to [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go).  
- **Test Your Code**: Include test cases with inputs and expected outputs.  

---  

## **Community Support**  

If you have any questions or suggestions:  

- **Questions**: Open a discussion under the **Discussions** tab.  
- **Issues**: Issues will be made available with bounty points for ACM AmWOC (Amrita Winter Of Code) and will be assigned on request to the participants.  

Weâ€™re happy to have you onboard. ðŸš€
